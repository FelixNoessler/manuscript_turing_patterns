# Manuscript code for: "Unlocking consumer coexistence: The role of self-organised spatial heterogeneity"

This repository contains scripts to reproduce the results in the manuscript.

## Julia scripts

The [`julia_scripts/run.jl`](julia_scripts/run.jl) file can be used to recreate the figures 2, S2, S6, S7, S8, S10, and S11 of the manuscript. This script calls several smaller scripts to run simulations and create the figures. All information how to run the code can be found inside the header of the [`julia_scripts/run.jl`](julia_scripts/run.jl) file.

## Python Jupyter notebook

The [`supporting_figures.ipynb`](supporting_figures.ipynb) contains the Python code to recreate the figures 1D, 3, S3, S4, S5, and S9.
